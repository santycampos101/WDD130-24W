    <p>The Home page will be the intro to myself and to my work that I have involving my experience in IT and Cybersecurity. I am planning to include information about myself and introducing myself to the employer. It will be simple and have things about me, what I offer to the job, and what I can do. This will provide insights on my experience, skills, and background. It will mainly be an introduction of who I am and what I do.</p>
